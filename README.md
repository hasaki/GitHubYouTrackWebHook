# GitHubYouTrackWebHook [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hasaki/GitHubYouTrackWebHook.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hasaki/GitHubYouTrackWebHook)

A configurable node-based server to respond to GitHub webhook requests for pushes and pull requests. If certain conditions are met, the hook will then update cases in a YouTrack system.

Based on the original [YouTrack service](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/you_track.rb) code, but updated and ported to node.js
